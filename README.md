# DarkSouls2Hook
Unfinished project - hooks into Dark Souls 2 address space and allows for item editing.

It's been over two years since I made this, so the details are fuzzy, but here's the gist of it: It uses some neat libraries that allow for memory reading and writing of other processes (thanks, winapi!). 
"But why would I use your buggy program when I could just use a tried and true cheat engine script?" 
What a stupid, stupid question. Here's why: the idea is that you'll be able to get a character just the way you like it, and then save the build. That way, next time you want to rp as Rocky or a poison-whipping butterfly man, all you have to do is press one button and... voila! You're floating like a butterfly and stinging like a 7 foot whip.
